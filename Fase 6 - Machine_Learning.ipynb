    "## **Fase 6 - Machine Learning: Construcción y Evaluación del Modelo Predictivo**\n",
    "*En esta fase, nos centramos en construir un modelo predictivo que sea capaz de estimar con precisión el **precio por noche** de las propiedades. Este paso es crucial para convertir los datos procesados en un conocimiento valioso, ya que nos permitirá hacer predicciones sobre el precio de futuras propiedades a partir de sus características. A través de técnicas de machine learning avanzadas, buscamos encontrar el modelo más eficiente, que no solo sea preciso, sino también interpretativo y generalizable*\n",
    "\n",
    "A lo largo de esta fase, aplicaremos una serie de algoritmos y evaluaremos su rendimiento, seleccionando aquel que mejor se ajuste a nuestras necesidades. Además, dedicaremos tiempo a ajustar los parámetros del modelo para maximizar su capacidad predictiva, asegurando así que sea robusto y confiable.\n",
    "Con este enfoque, buscamos no solo predecir el precio de forma precisa, sino también proporcionar una comprensión profunda de los factores clave que afectan los precios de las propiedades, lo que puede ser útil en la toma de decisiones empresariales y en el desarrollo de futuras investigaciones."
